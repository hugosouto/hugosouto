## Who I am

I'm Hugo Souto, a seasoned MSc in Data Science and former long-distance triathlete, committed to bringing focus and discipline to the field of machine learning.

With over ten years of experience as an analyst and manager and five years in data science, I've mainly worked as a Senior Data Scientist at [ComprasGov](www.gov.br/compras), the official procurement system of the Federal Government of Brazil. My expertise covers end-to-end data pipelines, from data engineering with multiple sources, to specialized data analysis for high-level management at the Ministry of Economy of Brazil. I am also experienced in dashboard development to comply with national transparency and regulations. In recent years, I've been focused on leading significant machine learning projects, one of which is being developed by me using Microsoft Azure AI.
